# Local Chat - Ollama Desktop Client

A native macOS desktop application for chatting with your local Ollama models. Built with Electron and React, this application provides a clean, modern interface for interacting with AI models running on your machine.


## Quick Start

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Development setup
- Building for distribution
- Installing the built app
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Features

### Model Management âœ…
- List and select from available local models with detailed cards
- View model information (parameters, quantization, size)
- Seamless model switching with persistent preferences
- Real-time model status monitoring
- Default model selection

### Response Modes âœ…
- Concise: Brief, direct answers focusing on key points
- Normal: Balanced responses with explanations and examples
- Longform: Detailed analysis with comprehensive context
- Visual mode selection with descriptive cards
- Mode persistence across conversations

### Chat Interface âœ…
- Clean, modern design optimized for AI conversations
- Real-time message streaming with live markdown preview
- Advanced markdown rendering with GitHub Flavored Markdown
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks with language detection
- Multi-line input with auto-resize
- Clear loading and error states
- Dark mode support
- Collapsible reasoning sections for models that expose their thought process
- Token counter with context window tracking
- Visual indicators for token usage thresholds

### Token Counter
The token counter helps you track your usage of the model's context window:

```
[ðŸ§®] 1,234 / 4,096 tokens (30%) [â–“â–“â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘] ðŸ”µ 500 ðŸŸ£ 734
```

- Total tokens / Context window size with percentage
- Visual progress bar that changes color based on usage:
  - Green: < 75% used
  - Yellow: 75-90% used
  - Red: > 90% used
- ðŸ”µ Prompt tokens (your input + conversation history)
- ðŸŸ£ Response tokens (model's output)

The context window size is automatically determined based on the model:
- 4,096 tokens for 7B models
- 8,192 tokens for larger models

### Chat History âœ…
- Persistent conversation storage with SQLite
- Browse and manage conversation history
- Delete conversations
- Automatic conversation creation and organization
- Real-time message syncing
- Smart conversation titles generated from first message

### System Integration (In Progress)
- Native macOS application
- Dock icon and system tray presence
- Application menu integration
- Window management
- System notifications
