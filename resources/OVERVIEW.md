# Local Chat - Technical Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of how Local Chat was built and how its various components work together.

## Application Architecture

### 1. Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Built a modern React application using TypeScript for type safety
- Used Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- Implemented components for:
  - Chat interface with streaming messages
  - Model selection with detailed cards
  - Response mode configuration
  - Token counting and visualization
  - Chat history management

### 2. Desktop Integration (Electron)
- Wrapped the React app in Electron to create a native desktop application
- Set up IPC (Inter-Process Communication) between:
  - Main Process: Handles system-level operations
  - Renderer Process: Runs the React UI
- Configured native features like:
  - Window management
  - System tray integration
  - Application menu
  - Dark mode support

### 3. Local Storage (SQLite)
- Used SQLite for persistent storage of:
  - Chat conversations
  - User messages
  - Application settings
- Implemented database operations in the main process
- Set up migrations for schema updates

### 4. API Integration (Ollama)
- Connected to locally running Ollama for AI model access
- Implemented features for:
  - Model discovery and selection
  - Real-time message streaming
  - Token counting
  - Context window management

## Build Process

### 1. Development Build
- React app runs on Vite's development server
- Electron watches for changes and reloads automatically
- Hot module replacement for fast development
- TypeScript type checking in real-time

### 2. Production Build
1. **React Build**
   - TypeScript compilation
   - Vite production build
   - Asset optimization
   - CSS minification

2. **Electron Packaging**
   - Bundle React build with Electron
   - Configure app metadata
   - Set up system integration
   - Create platform-specific builds

3. **macOS Specific**
   - Generate .icns icon
   - Create app bundle
   - Package as .dmg and .zip
   - Configure entitlements

## Key Technologies

### Frontend
- **React**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling
- **React Markdown**: Content rendering
- **KaTeX**: Math rendering
- **CodeMirror**: Code highlighting

### Backend
- **Electron**: Desktop framework
- **SQLite**: Local database
- **Ollama**: AI model integration
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment

### Build Tools
- **Vite**: Development and build
- **electron-builder**: Application packaging
- **TypeScript**: Compilation
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code formatting

## Application Flow

1. **Startup**
   - Electron launches main process
   - Main process creates window
   - React app initializes
   - Database connection established
   - Ollama connection verified

2. **User Interaction**
   - UI events in React
   - IPC messages to main process
   - Database operations
   - Ollama API calls
   - Real-time updates

3. **Chat Flow**
   - User input captured
   - Message sent to Ollama
   - Streaming response received
   - Real-time UI updates
   - Database storage
   - Token counting

## Design Decisions

### 1. Architecture
- Electron for native experience
- React for modern UI development
- SQLite for reliable local storage
- TypeScript for code quality

### 2. User Experience
- Real-time streaming for fast responses
- Dark mode for visual comfort
- Token visualization for context management
- Collapsible sections for clean UI

### 3. Development
- Vite for modern build tooling
- Hot reloading for fast development
- Type safety for reliability
- Component-based architecture

### 4. Distribution
- DMG for easy macOS installation
- ZIP for flexible deployment
- Auto-updates (planned)
- Code signing (planned)

## Future Considerations

### 1. Performance
- Message virtualization
- Database optimization
- Caching strategies
- Asset loading optimization

### 2. Features
- Plugin system
- Custom themes
- Advanced search
- Export/Import

### 3. Distribution
- Windows/Linux support
- App store distribution
- Auto-updates
- Analytics (optional)

### 4. Development
- Testing framework
- CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation
- Contributing guidelines
